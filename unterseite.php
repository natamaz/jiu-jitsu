                            Royce Gracie (Portuguese: [ˈʁɔjsi ˈɡɾejsi]; born 12 December 1966)[3] is a Brazilian retired
                            professional mixed martial artist,[4] a UFC Hall of Famer, and a Gracie Jiu-Jitsu practitioner.
                            A member of the Gracie family, he is considered to be one of the most influential figures in
                            the history of mixed martial arts (MMA).[5] He also competed at PRIDE Fighting Championships,
                            K-1's MMA events and at Bellator.

                        Gracie gained fame for his success in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Between 1993
                        and 1994, he was the tournament winner of UFC 1, UFC 2 and UFC 4, which at the time was
                        an openweight single-elimination tournament with minimal rules.
                    </p><br>
                    <blockquote>
                        “ I take all the opportunities that come my way and I am thankful that I have them.
                        Face life's challenges with confidence, dare to pursue your dreams and live to the
                        fullest just as my father did. When you like something, it's not work, it's a pleasure. “
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        He was also known for his rivalry with Ken Shamrock, whom he beat in UFC 1 and then fought to
                        a draw in the Superfight Championship rematch at UFC 5.[6] Royce would later compete in PRIDE
                        Fighting Championships, where he is most remembered for his 90-minute bout against Kazushi
                        Sakuraba in 2000,[7] and a controversial "Judo vs Jiu-Jitsu" mixed rules match against olympic
                        gold-medalist in Judo Hidehiko Yoshida at Pride Shockwave in 2002.
